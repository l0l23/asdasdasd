/**
 * Normally, these files are for true gamedata, but the TeamClerks load
 * plugin uses this file to determine:
 * 
 *    1) What modules are loadable (key names)
 *    2) What loading a module does (config value)
 *
 * Almost everything module-driven can be expressed as a config file to
 * be executed on the server. I started with my skeetpractice config and
 * slowly added more and more complexity to it before it became a plugin.
